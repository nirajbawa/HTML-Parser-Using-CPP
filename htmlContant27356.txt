 SQL Server JOINS
 In real life, we store our data in multiple logical tables that are linked together by a common key value in
 relational databases like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and others. As a result,
 we constantly need to get data from two or more tables into the desired output based on some conditions. We can
 quickly achieve this type of data in SQL Server using the SQL JOIN clause.
 This article gives a complete overview of JOIN and its different types with an example.
 
 INNER JOIN
 
 This JOIN returns all records from multiple tables that satisfy the specified join condition. It is the simple
 and most popular
 form of join and assumes as a default join. If we omit the INNER keyword with the JOIN query, we will get the
 same output.
 SELF JOIN
 A table is joined to itself using the SELF JOIN. It means that each table row is combined with itself and with
 every other table row. The SELF JOIN can be thought of as a JOIN of two copies of the same tables.
 We can do this with the help of table name aliases to assign a specific name to each table's instance. The table
 aliases enable us to use the table's temporary name that we are going to use in the query.
 It's a useful way to extract hierarchical data and comparing rows inside a single table.
